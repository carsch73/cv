        <p><em>Web Developer, Artist, and Angel Channeler</em></p>
        <p>I've always been a person that when I am interested in learning something, I will find a way to learn it myself.
          I have always been interested in web development, I found Udemy and am teaching myself how to finally realize my
          dream in web development. This is the same way I taught myself to become an oil portrait painter. I am also very
          spiritual and connected to my guardian angels, one may even call it intuition.
          I feel that if you take the time to silence the mind, listen in to your gut feeling, intution, the guidance and answers
          follow. They give you those synchronicites that lead you to sites, books, people who can help guide you toward the right
          answers. This technique, quieting the mind is one I implement with web development, because wonderful inspirations flow
          through, inturn this helps me create and develop awesome pages, and apps.</p>

          <em>I was taught on how the hum consciousness and subconsciousness works, styding the works of
            Carl Jung and many more. I learned how the mind never forgets and lying dormant are tiny
            memories that we have forgotten, but that our subconsciousness is trying to protect. In here lies
            the answers in solving issues that have bleed into our lives, the answers as thy why our body
            reacts a certain way, why we do certain things. These lead to behavior issues, substance abuse or dependency.
            Once we become aware of these issues we have tucked away, we can begin to get to the root of the problem and heal.</em>
